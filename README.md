# Traffic-flow-using-Time-Series-analysis
Urban centers around the globe are increasingly burdened by traffic congestion, a challenge exacerbated by rapid
urbanization and the exponential growth of vehicular populations. As transportation infrastructures face mounting
strain, the need for accurate and reliable traffic flow forecasting has become paramount. This project aims to
address this critical issue by leveraging time series forecasting methodologies to model and predict urban traffic
volumes using historical data.
By capturing temporal dynamics—such as daily and weekly seasonality—and uncovering latent trends, the
project aspires to inform intelligent traffic management systems capable of proactive intervention. Through the
integration of statistical models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA) and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning
architectures (e.g., LSTM, GRU), we evaluate the effectiveness of different forecasting techniques in enhancing
predictive accuracy.
The outcomes of this project hold significant potential for improving traffic signal control, alleviating congestion,
optimizing public transportation scheduling, and reducing environmental impacts through improved fuel efficiency
and lower emissions. Ultimately, this work contributes to the development of smart, data-driven urban mobility
solutions that align with the broader vision of sustainable and resilient cities.
